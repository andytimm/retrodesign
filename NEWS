retrodesign v0.2.2 (Release date: 2024-03-27)
==============

Changes:

* Resolved a bug wherein the type M error for retrodesign was not equal to
that of retrodesign_closed_form. A test case for this type of issue was
to prevent this from occuring again.


retrodesign v0.2 (Release date: 2023-08-23)
==============

Changes:

* Added use of a non-central t-distribution in the functions that use
simulation. This makes a really minor difference outside tiny-n cases, but
does improve results in those cases. Thanks to Martijn for the initial
implementation I worked from!
* retro_design is soft-depricated in favor of retro_design_closed_form, to
make what the function does much clearer.
* The original retrodesign function was ported with only minor changes, which
meant it could give misleading results if instructions to use a list input for
A were ignored. This is now resolved- a package should anticipate common
input errors.
* Names of outputs are now consistent across all functions.
* Vignette was updated for above changes.
