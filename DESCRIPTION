Description: This package provides tools for working with Type S (Sign) and
    Type M (Magnitude) errors, as proposed in Gelman and Tuerlinckx (2000) and
    Gelman & Carlin (2014). In addition to simply calculating the probability of
    Type S/M error, the package includes functions for calculating these errors
    across a variety of effect sizes for comparison, and reccomended sample size
    given 'tolerances' for Type S/M errors. To improve the speed of these
    calculations, closed forms solutions for the probability of a Type S/M error
    from Lu, Qiu, and Deng (2018) are implemented. As of 0.1.0, this includes
    support only for simple research designs, but I will expand it to ANOVA and
    other more complicated designs in the future with community support. See the
    package vignette for a fuller exposition on how Type S/M errors arise in
    research, and how to analyze them using the type of design analysis proposed
    in the above papers.
