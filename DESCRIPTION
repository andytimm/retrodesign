Description: Provides tools for working with Type S (Sign) and
    Type M (Magnitude) errors, as proposed in Gelman and Tuerlinckx (2000)
    <doi:10.1007/s001800000040> and
    Gelman & Carlin (2014) <doi:10.1177/1745691614551642>.
    In addition to simply calculating the probability of
    Type S/M error, the package includes functions for calculating these errors
    across a variety of effect sizes for comparison, and recommended sample size
    given "tolerances" for Type S/M errors. To improve the speed of these
    calculations, closed forms solutions for the probability of a Type S/M error
    from Lu, Qiu, and Deng (2018) <doi:10.1111/bmsp.12132>
    are implemented. As of 1.0.0, this includes
    support only for simple research designs. See the
    package vignette for a fuller exposition on how Type S/M errors arise in
    research, and how to analyze them using the type of design analysis proposed
    in the above papers.
